                <p>
                    My name is Abbas, I am a 23-year-old guy from east London. Growing up in east London from a working-class immigrant family was often hard. It didn‚Äôt help by the fact that growing up in school I also knew I was different, I wasn't like my friends. As I grew older, I learned that this was because I am also LGBTQ+, this then made school a struggle, but I found ways to use my LGBTQ+ as an advantage. As many LGBTQ+ people, I found I had a love and great ability in design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After school I decided I wanted to leverage my passion for design and decided to study fashion design with a focus on modern knitwear. Knitwear is a very intricate process, it requires extreme attention to detail to get right. While I was learning different methods of knitting, I got the opportunity to work on a major industrial knitting machine where I had my first experience of programming a task into a machine and I really enjoyed the experience. From this experience I started to learn there are many aspects of industrial fashion that are similar to software engineering.  
                </p>
                <P>
                    For my main project in university, I wanted to focus on sustainability, Afterall, fashion is one of the biggest pollutants in the world. I really wanted to try and make positive change in the industry. For the project I grew my own material from bacteria, the process can be mass produced using less space than farming and can be produced in the same production facility preventing the materials from being transported thousands of miles, resulting in an amazing 65% reduction carbon created from the process. The process was eye opening for me. We analysed problems, adapted to change and iterated continuously through the project in a very similar way as agile software development teams do.

                <P>
                    Unfortunately the world entered into a worldwide pandemic. Fashion seemed particularly affected, the Financial times reported that about 30% of UK fashion jobs were expected to be lost as a result of the pandemic. Given these variables I decided to postpone my final year and instead refocus on an industry which still allows me to be creative but also has far more opportunities. Since the pandemic I have not just been sitting around doing nothing, I love design so I started to look into how I could use my design skills to help in other industries and that's when I started getting interested in technology. I was drawn to technology because designing good products can have far reaching effects for millions of people in tech. Technology is inclusive, it's democratic, people work to make technology for all people with all types of accessibility needs. Technology can be the great equaliser in society.

                <h1 class="center">WHY FOUNDERS & CODERS?</h1>
                <p>
                    Founders & coders seems like a perfect cultural fit for me, firstly you care a lot about what I care about, diversity, inclusion, equal opportunities and sustainability which I've spent my life trying to champion. Additionally, to fight prejudice in the workplace I know I need to be above reproach and I can clearly see that founders & coders have the perfect mixture of experts and people with experience in industry that can hone in my potential turning me into the professional I want to be and together we can create real positive change in the world.
